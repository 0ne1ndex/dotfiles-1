# The Nord Setup
My setup is built around the excellent [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord) color scheme. I've taken every effort to make sure that every component of the system fits right in with the rest and looks consistent. Suggestions and critique that understand this goal of the setup are welcome.

Below is a guided tour of what this setup looks like presently:
